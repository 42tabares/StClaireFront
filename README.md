# St Claire Web App üè•

The St Claire Web App allows you to manage medical specialties, users within each specialty and appointment dates for each user!

Here below is a list of steps to install and run!

## Installation

1. Download both this repo and the back-end repo https://github.com/42tabares/StClaireBack
2. Launch a MySQL workbench server in local host port 3306.
3. Create a schema named "stclaire" do not edit it, the program just need the schema to exist.
4. Input your user data to the application.properties files in StClaireBack/src/main/resources

- Be advised, you may change the port and schema name in the application.properties too if your MySQL config is different!

5. Launch the server with StClaireApplication.java from your prefered Java IDE.
6. Launch the front-end with a Live Server, I might suggest the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer addon for VScode
7. The application should now be running properly.
